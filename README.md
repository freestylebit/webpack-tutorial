# Webpack Tutorial for Practical People

## Getting Started
If this is your first time with this tutorial, you'll need to set up your computer first.  Provided you have installed (node)[https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/] and (npm)[http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm] in your system, follow this page to [install webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html).

```
npm install -g webpack
```

Once you're good, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:freestylebit/webpack-tutorial.git
cd webpack-tutorial/
```

## General Flow
If this is your first time here, start with the first lesson and follow the README.md for additional guidance:

```bash
cd lessons/01-basic_io/
```

In general, navigate to the **lessons/** directory and go through each directory one by one. There should be a README.md that should give you a synopsis on what the webpack configurations do.

This repo is written with the expectation everyone starts from page one (in this case, 01-basic_io) since each lesson has its own special steps for compilations.

## Cheers!
