# Basic I/O

This is a simple example of how a webpack configuration file is set up. It consists of a JSON array with two attributes: `entry` and `output`. We dictate that we want `src/scripts.js` to be submitted for bundling and output the results as `min.js` in the `dist/` directory. You can see this by checking out the `webpack.config.js` file.

Go ahead, give it a spin!

```
webpack
```

# Sweet, what's next?

```
cd ../02-starting_point
```
