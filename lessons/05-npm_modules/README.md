# Adding third party dependencies

NPM (Node Package Manager) was originally exclusive to back end server modules, but now it's adapted to yield a good number of front end modules, as well!.  Rather than downloading the minified files of your favorite front end framework, you can just use `npm` to acquire them (e.g. `npm install react`).

I've included a few in this demo! Run the following and you should get a bundle that includes `angular`, `react`, and `jquery`!

```
webpack
```

# Kick ass!
