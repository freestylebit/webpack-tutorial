# Automatic Entry

*This is kind of like 03-multiple_files/.  Short-sighted by me, so feel free to skim this if you'd like.*

## Throw everything into one bag!

Like in 03-multiple_files/, you can use node to mock parts of your configuration object.  Depending on your front end architecture, you might want to create a collection of code into one bundle for simplicity.  To repeat, don't be afraid to concoct algorithms of your own!

```bash
webpack
```

and open the index.html file in this lesson to see all five .js files in src/ just work!

## Got it!

```bash
cd ../07-loaders__injecting_css
```
